# Jonathan Harker's Journal.

_24 October._—A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming, but only the same story: "Not yet reported." Mina's morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.

# Telegram, October 24th.

_Rufus Smith, Lloyd's, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M. Vice-Consul, Varna._

"_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles."
